In this project I am going to build the Google.com homepage and then add to that by building the Google.com search results page.
This is my first project taken from "The Odin Project" and will showcase the following skills:
1. Basic HTML
2. Basic CSS
3. Using a remote repository: in this case github
4. Working within the command line
5. Working with an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment): in this case Cloud9
6. Working with a Linux System
7. Working with Developer's Tools that are built into web browers.  Learning DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation.
8. Basics of how the web works and the differences between front end and back end development.
